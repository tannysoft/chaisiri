                        <p>ARForms exclusively provides the new feature of Dynamic Dropdown Field. The Dynamic Dropdown Field is most popular and trending feature of Form Builder Plugin nowadays. You can create Dynamic Dropdown Field by doing few modifications in the ARForms Simple Dropdown Field.</p>
                        <p>The Dynamic Dropdown Field enables you to set the dropdown's options for child dropdown field dynamically which are dependent on the selected option of Parent Dropdown Field through Parent-Child connectivity of multiple dropdown fields.</p>
                        <p>The Dynamic Dropdown Field will generate the options dynamically for child dropdown field which is dependent on parent dropdown field. To generate the options dynamically you need enable the <strong>Dynamic Option</strong> and map the parent dropdown field from <strong>Select Parent</strong> dropdown of the field options of child dropdown field. It is compulsary to upload the <strong>CSV file</strong> from the field options of child dropdown field which contains parent dropdown field's each options mapped with child dropdown field's each options after Dynamic Option is enabled and Parent Dropdown is mapped. Please note that it is mandatory to start the csv file from the first cell of the csv file.</p>

                        <p>One to One use case can be implemented when you set the parent dropdown field dependency to only one child dropdown field. In this case, when parent dropdown's selected option is changed only one child dropdown field's options will be changed which has been dependent on parent dropdown field.</p>
                        <p>In this case the csv file for generating dynamic options will contain only two columns from which first column will contain the parent dropdown field's options and second column will contain the child dropdown field's optoins.</p>

                        <p>One to Many use case can be implemented when you set the same parent dropdown field dependency to more than one child dropdown field. In this case, when parent dropdown's selected option is changed more than one child dropdown field's options will be changed which has been dependent on parent dropdown field.</p>
                        <p>In this case the csv file for generating dynamic options will contain more than two columns from which first column will contain the parent dropdown field's options and other columns will contain the child dropdown field's optoins for each child dropdown field mapped with same parent dropdown field.</p>

                        <h2>Running Total with Payment Addon</h2>Running Total widely used to add the final amount (the result of running total) as a <em>Price</em> in <em>Payment Addon, </em>ie. maybe product of amount and quantity or simply sum of two fields much can be explained by illustrating an example. let's consider the above-illustrated form and sum of two field <em>'price'</em> &amp; <em>'charges'</em> as the final amount to be paid by the user.

                        <p>ARForms allow you to set a condition on the field. Using conditional logic, you can <em>show</em> or <em>hide fields</em>, <em>page</em>, <em>section </em>or can disable/enable <em>fields</em> or even can<em> set values of the particular field.</em></p><b><i>ARForms Conditional Logic facilitates,</i></b>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>Which allow a user to add a Combination of condition to perform any operation on any one field and vice-versa. We can set Conditional Logic to apply the following operation on fields, <em>we have added new operation than our previous version</em>

                        </ul>You can put conditional logic on any field, but for that, you need at least one field for conditional logic. Even you can apply conditional logic to a section as well as on Page Break. <em>Unlike our previous version</em>, Now Conditional Logic has been upgraded to Form-wise rather than that of Field-wise, So users can easily manage Conditional Logic of many fields and it is also very easy to maintain &amp; modify it.

Let's see these in some brief with an example, to populate a form field like '<em>City'</em> and you want to populate that field as '<em>New York</em>' then you have to add a query string to your URL, this query string follows a pattern like <em><strong>"item_meta[</strong>{field_id}<strong>] = </strong>{reuired data to add}<b>"</b>.</em>

                    <div class="card">
                        ARForms provides a facility to pre-populate popup form fields. You can achieve it without using the query string to the URL of your form.
                        <br><br>Let's see in detail with an example.<br><br>
                        For example, you have a field labeled as '<em>City</em>' and you want this field populated as '<em>New York</em>' in your modal(popup) form then you just need to add one more parameter in the shortcode for ARForms popup which is <em><strong>preset_data</strong></em>.
                        <br/><br/>Following is a pattern to pre-populate specific field in a popup,<br><br>
                        <pre>preset_data="item_meta_{FIELD_ID}||{VALUE}"</pre>
                        <code>FIELD_ID</code> - replace this with your specific form field id.
                        <br><code>VALUE</code> - replace this with value for specific form field you want to populate with.
                        <br/><br/>Now your shortcode will be like,<br><br>
                        <em><strong>[ARForms_popup id=123 desc='Click here to open Form' type='link' width='800' modaleffect='fade_in'  is_fullscreen='no' overlay='0.6' is_close_link='yes' modal_bgcolor='#000000' preset_data="item_meta_1000||New York"]</strong></em><br>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Pre Populate Multiple Fields</h3>
                        <p>You can pre-populate multiple fields of your form in popup using <code><strong>~!~</strong></code> separator.</p>
                        <p>Following is a pattern to prepopulate specific field in popup,</p>
                        <pre>preset_data="item_meta_1000||New York<strong>~!~</strong>item_meta_1001||USA"</pre>

                        <h3>Pre Populate Checkbox Fields</h3>
                        You can prepopulate the checkbox field too. To check multiple options of your checkbox field in the popup you need to add values using <code><strong>^!^</strong></code> separator just like following,
                        <br/><br/>
                        <pre>preset_data="item_meta_1002||opt1^!^opt2^!^opt3~!~item_meta_1003||{VALUE}"</pre>
